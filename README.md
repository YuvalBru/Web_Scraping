# Web Scraping - Osher Dighorkar and Yuval Brunshtein 

#### In this project we examine a market type  website, https://www.ad.co.il/ which sells different type of goods.

##### We examine the site and web scrape using BeautifulSoup4 library in a Jupyter Notebook environment extracting all of the details regarding Renu manufactured cars between the years 1980-2015. We obtain the data and build a 70x20 pandas data frame in order to later on in the project create a Machine Learning model.



#### Data Set Information - The data consists of 20 columns containing the following detials:
| Fields | Manufactor | Year | Model | Hand | Gear | capacity_Engine | Engine_type | Prev_ownership | Curr_ownership | Area | City | Price | 
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | 

| ...Fields | Pic_num | Cre_date | Repub_date | Description | Color | Km | Test | Supply_score | 
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |


#### The features  for each car which falls under the aforementioned criteria will be used in order to create an effective and hopefully accurate Machine Learning Model.
